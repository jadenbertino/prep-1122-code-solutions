          <p>
            Lucas conceived Raiders of the Lost Ark in the eraly 1970s. Seeking
            to modernize the serial films of the early 20th-century, he

            Spielberg chose to tone down the dark tone and graphic violence in
            the next installment. During the five years between The Temple of
